### Adding Chainflip APT Repo
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL repo.chainflip.io/keys/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

Verify the key's authenticity:
```
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg
```

Important: Make sure you see the following output from the terminal:
```
pub rsa3072 2022-11-08 [SC] [expires: 2024-11-07]
BDBC3CF58F623694CD9E3F5CFB3E88547C6B47C6
uid Chainflip Labs GmbH <dev@chainflip.io>
sub rsa3072 2022-11-08 [E] [expires: 2024-11-07]
```
After that, add Chainflip's Repo to apt sources list:
```
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/chainflip.gpg] https://repo.chainflip.io/perseverance/$(lsb_release -c -s) $(lsb_release -c -s) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chainflip.list
```

### Installing The Packages
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chainflip-cli chainflip-node chainflip-engine1.1
```

### Generating Validator Keys
```
chainflip-cli generate-keys --path /etc/chainflip/keys
```
**Make sure to back up your Seed Phrase and make a note of the public keys and account ID. You will need the Seed Phrase if you ever need to restore your node or recover your funds if you lose access to the node. DO NOT LOSE THIS.**
And you must ensure that the public Ethereum address generated above has at least 0.1 gETH. Make sure you send 0.1 gETH to this account's address before trying to add funds to your validator node

### Create the engine config file
Replace IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE with your server's public IP Address. To find it, use: `curl -w "\n" ifconfig.me`
Additionally, provide the ws_endpoint and http_endpoint specific to your chosen Ethereum client. The format varies based on the client you're using.
```
# Default configurations for the CFE
[node_p2p]
node_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/node_key_file"
ip_address = "IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_NODE"
port = "8078"
 
[state_chain]
ws_endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"
signing_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/signing_key_file"
 
[eth]
# Ethereum private key file path. This file should contain a hex-encoded private key.
private_key_file = "/etc/chainflip/keys/ethereum_key_file"
 
[eth.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "wss://my_local_geth_node:8546"
http_endpoint = "https://my_local_geth_node:8545"
 
# Optional
# [eth.backup_rpc]
# ws_endpoint = "wss://some_public_rpc.com:443/<secret_access_key>"
# http_endpoint = "https://some_public_rpc.com:443/<secret_access_key>"
 
[dot.rpc]
ws_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"
http_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot.chainflip.io:443"
 
# Optional
# [dot.backup_rpc]
# ws_endpoint = "wss://rpc-pdot2.chainflip.io:443"
# http_endpoint = "https://rpc-pdot2.chainflip.io:443"
 
[btc.rpc]
basic_auth_user = "flip"
basic_auth_password = "flip"
http_endpoint = "http://a108a82b574a640359e360cf66afd45d-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
 
# Optional
# [btc.backup_rpc]
# basic_auth_user = "flip2"
# basic_auth_password = "flip2"
# http_endpoint = "http://second-node-424380952.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
 
# Optional (default: 36079)
# [logging]
# command_server_port = 36079
```

### Starting the Node
```
sudo systemctl start chainflip-node
```
check the service status 
```
systemctl status chainflip-node
```
At this point, you will need to wait for your node to catch up with the latest block. You can find the latest block on our [Block Explorer](https://blocks-perseverance.chainflip.io/)

Check the Node:
```
journalctl -f -u chainflip-node.service
```
The node will ouput the following when started:

Starting the Engine `chainflip-engine`
```
sudo systemctl start chainflip-engine1.1
```
To check on the service, use status.
```
systemctl status chainflip-engine1.1
```
Check the engine logs:
```
journalctl -f -u chainflip-engine1.1.service
```
You should see some output that looks like this:
```
